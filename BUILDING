Building in Windows:

Run win\buildwin.bat (VC++ .NET 2003) or win\buildwin_vc6.bat (VC++ 6.0). There are also
MS VC++ projects in library and program directories.

The build has been tested using MS Visual C++ 6 SP5 and MS Visual C++ .NET 2003
under Windows XP.


Building in other systems:

(chmod +x Makefile.am buildconf.sh config.guess config.status config.sub configure install-sh missing mkinstalldirs usemarcon-config.in)
